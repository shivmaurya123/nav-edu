	   1.	WOG Technology- Filtration process in the Sewage treatment plant 	
Filtration is the process of removing solid particles from a gaseous or liquid fluid using a filter material that solves this problem while keeping the solid particles. The objective is to generate a sewage treatment system that is safer and more environment-friendly. A sewage treatment plant circulates air to help sewage and complex compounds break down quickly. Sewage treatment plants are used to treat wastewater from both commercial and residential sources. Wastewater from both commercial and residential sources is treated in sewage treatment plants. We can reuse the water we are getting from the wastewater system after the particles have been removed. The objective is to produce clean and efficient effluent. This type of filtration technique is required for various reasons to reuse wastewater. The two primary types of filtration utilized in wastewater treatment systems are particle filtration and membrane filtration.
1.	Membrane Bioreactors for Sewage Water Treatment			
The membrane bioreactor sewage treatment plant (MBR) is a revolutionary wastewater treatment system. It refers to a membrane unit or subsystems that are integrated. Fine screening, the Membrane Zone, and, in most cases, some type of post-disinfection operation are all included in a membrane bioreactor system. A membrane is a two-dimensional material that is used to separate fluid components based on their relative sizes or electrical charges. This level of filtration allows high-quality effluent to pass through the membranes, obviating the need for sedimentation and filtration processes used in wastewater treatment. We equipped the MBR Sewage Treatment Plant with an automated sludge system that ensures uninterrupted operation. Its major goal is to reduce chemical usage. MBR Sewage Treatment Plant has the following features: It included an automatic sludge system in our solution to ensure smooth operation and minimal disruption. It can treat water to a high standard. Its goal is to save money while reducing the number of chemicals used.
1.	Various types of sewage treatment plants.				

A sewage treatment plant is an exclusive drainage system that treats waste from a property so that it can be discharged into the water bodies without harming the environment. It circulated air in sewage treatment plants to encourage the growth of microorganisms that break down sewage. Sewage Treatment plants come in different dimensions as per the requirement of the system.
•	Activated Sludge Process (ASP)- One of the most common waste treatment methods is the activated sludge process. They used it for both domestic and large sewage treatment plants.
•	Rotating Disc System (RDS) Wastewater Treatment Plants - This wastewater treatment system provides a dependable and robust solution that produces high-quality effluent.
•	SBRs (Sequence Batch Reactors) is known for producing high-quality effluent. These systems are like ASP systems in that they have a primary chamber and a secondary treatment chamber. 


1.	Purpose of Treating Sewage Water				
Water is the main component of several manufacturing units in the country. It is an easily available natural resource but chemical reactions of the industries produce it as a by-product after the processing. Wastewater treatment removes all toxic and non-toxic substances, and harmful chemicals from the water and makes it reusable for several requirements. It removes all toxic compounds from the water and recycles them with various treatments. The various wastewater treatment plants include chemical treatment, biological treatment, chemical and biological treatment combined, and heat treatment. The primary objective of wastewater treatment plants is to produce water that can be reused or disposed of in a more environmentally friendly manner. This is a procedure for cleaning industrial wastewater so that we can recycle it and if this water gets disposed of in the water bodies, it will not create water pollution. 


1.	sewage treatment plants operation				
A sewage treatment plant has several stages of treatment. They all remove contaminants from the water and allow it to be reused.
•	Preliminary sewage Treatment- This is the first step in the sewage treatment process, and its primary goal is to remove coarse solids and other large materials that are found in raw wastewater.
•	The primary goal of this treatment is to reduce any heavy solids (organic and inorganic) that settle to the bottom through sedimentation, while oil, grease, and lighter solids float to the top through skimming.
•	Secondary sewage treatment- For sludge processing, the biological solids removed during secondary sedimentation, known as secondary or biological sludge, are combined with primary sludge. Over 80% of contaminants are removed from water during this process, making it soluble and ready for disposal.


1.	A biological sewage treatment system				
The biological treatment of wastewater is an important step in the wastewater treatment process. Secondary treatment is used to describe removing contaminants that remain after primary treatment. Microbes will be used to degrade wastewater contaminants. This method of wastewater treatment relies on bacteria, algae, fungi, and protozoa to break down unstable organic wastes into stable inorganic forms using normal cellular processes. We can break it down into two categories.
•	Biological Aerobic Treatment (with oxygen) removes up to 98 percent of organic contaminants from wastewater.
•	Biological Anaerobic Treatment (without oxygen)- This wastewater treatment method treats high-strength wastewater by using organisms that can function without oxygen.


1.	Advantages of MBR technology					
MBR systems are the most widely used wastewater treatment systems in a variety of industries. We used it in the paper industry, the dairy industry, and the oil industry to treat chemical wastewater. Using this technique has several advantages. Here are a few examples:
•	Energy consumption is minimal.
•	During the treatment, no chemicals are required.
•	Effluent water reuse can be done..
•	The effluent has a high quality– Water treated with MBR has a prime quality because all micro-compounds are filtered out.
•	Compared to traditional activated sludge, it requires 50% less space.
•	MBR has a much higher organic content in the water, resulting in better quality. It effectively removed biodegradable materials at higher biomass concentrations.
•	Lower Sludge Disposal Costs- Because the system produces less sewage, the cost of removing it from the site is reduced.
•	Less sludge dewatering is required because the sludge has a high solid content.


1.	Importance of Sewage Water Treatment.				
Sewage treatment is a process that improves the quality of water by removing all contaminants and allowing it to be reused or discharged back into the environment. Untreated wastewater contains high levels of organic material and toxic compounds that are hazardous to human health, the environment, and water bodies. The main goal of sewage treatment plants is to produce water that can be reused or disposed of in a more environmentally friendly and healthy manner. Industrial wastewater treatment plants are designed to handle large amounts of waste using innovative technology. During the wastewater treatment process, a large amount of sludge is collected which can be used to generate electricity.


1.	Different Types of Pollutants in Sewage Waste			
We can find various types of pollutants in sewage waste:
•	Domestic sewage pollutants- It transports sanitary sewage, which is used wastewater from homes and apartments.
•	Industrial sewage Pollutants - Wastewater coming from manufacturing industries or chemical processes cause maximum water pollutants. It needs to be recycled before its disposal.
•	Storms sewage Pollutants - are precipitation runoff that is collected in a pipe system or in open channels.
•	Chemical sewage pollutants- Chemical pollutants are the most common type of pollutants found in water, and they can infiltrate underground and surface water bodies.
•	Groundwater sewage Pollutants- Fertilizers and pesticides used on crops can seep into the ground and contaminate rivers and waterbeds beneath the surface.
•	Microbiological sewage pollutants- bacteria, protozoa, and viruses can infiltrate water and cause diseases like cholera.
