	   1.	The Domestic Sewage Treatment Process		
Domestic sewage treatment is a wastewater treatment system that deals with much waste produced in a residential area. It treats much residential wastewater that includes harmful chemicals to protect human health and the environment. Domestic sewage, which is little over 90% water by weight, is also likely to include disease-causing bacteria. The expected volume of sewage generated by houses determines the size and capacity of the wastewater treatment system. Sanitary sewage is sewage that is created in residential areas.
There are several types of wastewater treatment methods, including:
Preliminary- This technique will clean the wastewater of big suspended particles.
Primary- Using sedimentation, this procedure will remove big particles that settle at the bottom of the effluent.
Secondary- This step removes microorganisms from wastewater before we release it into the environment.
Tertiary treatment entails the application of chemicals to sterilize the water. It is a very expensive technique used in special conditions only.


2.	Chemical Treatment of Wastewater					
Chemical wastewater recycling treatment uses a variety of chemicals to reduce contaminants in the wastewater. Various metals will dissolve more quickly in wastewater if chemicals are used. A dissolved ingredient becomes a dissoluble substance that can be filtered out of the liquid during precipitation. Chlorine, hydrogen oxides, and sodium chlorite will be used in the chemical treatment procedure. In the chemical treatment process, we employ many methods, including:
Neutralization is a procedure that is used to keep or change the pH of the wastewater.
Chemical precipitation is recovering metals from wastewater by dissolving or precipitating the metals in the waste using a range of chemicals.
Coagulation and flocculation: This process combines all of the water’s finer particles into larger particles that settle out.
Hard water is converted to soft water by adding sodium ions, and chlorine is added to sanitize the water before it is dumped into bodies of water.


3.	Working on Domestic Sewage Water Treatment System			
Domestic sewage, also known as domestic wastewater, is wastewater that is discharged from private residences such as homes and apartments. It collects waste liquid materials from toilets, bathtubs, showers, kitchens, and sinks that run into the sewage system. A home sewage treatment plant’s main purpose is to eliminate pollutants, toxins, and microbes from wastewater. This comprises a few steps, each of which is followed by a domestic sewage treatment facility.
Huge materials or grids will be removed in the first step, and we will decompose large pollutants into smaller ones.
The organic and inorganic material that settled at the bottom, as well as oil and greases floating on the top layer, will be segregated in this step.
It will process the biological waste material in the third step, followed by disinfection, nutrient removal, or solid removal, and finally, discharge into surrounding water bodies.


4.	How To the Treatment of Wastewater 				
Wastewater treatment is an essential process since dumping untreated water into the environment can have catastrophic consequences. A residential sewage treatment facility’s primary purpose is to eliminate pollutants, toxins, and microorganisms from wastewater. It’s broken down into steps, each of which is followed by a residential sewage treatment plant. Huge materials or grids will be removed first, and they will decompose large pollutants into smaller ones. The organic and inorganic material that settles at the bottom, as well as the oil and greases that float on top, will be separated using this method. The third phase will involve the processing of biological waste, disinfection, nutrient removal, or solid removal, and discharge into surrounding bodies of water.


5.	What is a BOOT/BOO model?						
One of the greatest long-term water supply alternatives is Build Own Operate (BOO) & Build Own Operate Transfer (BOOT) model. BOOT is a private-sector model in which it formed a private corporation to fund, design, build, and run a facility for a limited time before it is handed back to the government. Both the commercial and public sectors collaborate in this arrangement. A specialist corporation, a concessioner, provides water as a service. The public partner buys water and makes no infrastructure investments, saving up to 30% on water cycle expenses. The build-own-operate (BOO) contract is a significant public-private partnership (PPP) project delivery mechanism.


6.	Types of Wastewater Generated by Domestic Areas			
The removal of organic materials and nutrients is the primary goal of wastewater treatment. A considerable amount of organic stuff is present in this type of sewage. Our homes produce this effluent daily because of normal household activities. We can divide domestic wastewater into two categories.
Blackwaters: Human excrement, urine, and other materials from toilets and urinals are included in this form of effluent. It holds all of the waste that we drain through our home’s drainage system. It is the primary source of toxins produced in our daily lives. The most dangerous to people is blackwater, which contains germs, viruses, and parasites.
Greywater: It consists of all non-hazardous wastewater discharged from homes, buildings, hospitals, and offices. Showers, sinks, washing machines, washbasins, and other sources that have not come into touch with human waste produce this effluent. It is less dangerous than blackwaters, yet it is necessary to treat.


7.	Why Wastewater Treatment is important?				
Wastewater must be treated before we can reuse it in several ways. Water is a major component of most industries’ production units, causing a continual supply of water daily. This amount of water will be unavailable if it is not recycled. Sewage contains several nutrients, chemicals, and metals that can only be recovered by sewage treatment, and there is a high demand for natural resources. We employ various sewage management technologies to maintain our ecosystem by recycling spent wastewater because it is vital for future generations. Wastewater must be treated before being disposed of in a water body because it can affect human and aquatic life.
8.	Advantages of Domestic Sewage Treatment System			
Domestic sewage, as we all know, contains a variety of hazardous and non-hazardous components that must be treated before being released into the environment. The domestic Sewage Treatment System has several advantages. Among them are:
Domestic sewage treatment plants are more time-efficient since they can handle huge amounts of sewage. Aside from reusability, wastewater is purified and utilized for a variety of applications.
Sewage treatment plants are environment-friendly since they process all harmful substances that come out of any residential area and make them suitable for disposal in nearby water bodies.
It requires very little room and may be deployed in any area with no expenditure.
It encourages people to live in underdeveloped areas. We can place this system in residential areas where there is no major drainage system. This sewage treatment plant will handle all of the drainages from residences and apartments.


9.	Purpose of Implementing the BOO Model				
BOOT is a private-sector model in which it formed a company to fund, construct, build, and operate a facility for a set period before returning it to the government. This system brings together the private and public sectors. A concessioner is a specialized corporation that provides as-service water.
It lowers infrastructure costs: In this approach, the public sector can benefit from the private sector’s efficiencies while investing very little. The private sector handles the planning and construction, while the public sector completes the project on time and within budget.
It lowers public debt: Private companies will make All significant main investments, reducing the burden on the public sector.
Both organizations will focus on their areas of expertise.
With the collaboration of both companies, we can deploy new sophisticated technologies or innovations.
FAQ:
What is treated domestic sewage?				
Treated domestic sewage is known as effluent or wastewater which has passed through a sewage treatment plant. Sewage treatment will be done in multiple phases to reduce all harmful bacteria, pollutants, and toxins in the sewage before treatment. Domestic sewage that has been treated is safe to dispose of. If untreated water is dumped directly into bodies of water, it poses a major threat to surface water and underwater aquatic ecosystems. Treated water is free of harmful bacteria and bacteria that cause illness.	
How does domestic waste pollute water?			
All of the domestic area’s wastewater will be dumped into surrounding aquatic bodies, causing pollution. Chemicals and germs found in sewage water can cause significant sickness. Pathogens and bacteria found in domestic sewage handle a variety of ailments. We know that untreated water can contribute to the spread of malaria-causing microorganisms in an area. Domestic sewage is a vital source of plant nutrients, but it can also cause water contamination if it is not cleaned.

How does a domestic sewage treatment plant work?		
The primary goal of a home sewage treatment facility is to remove pollutants, toxins, and germs from wastewater. It is divided into several stages, each of which is followed by a home sewage treatment plant. Huge materials or grids will be removed first, and they will decompose large pollutants into smaller ones. This process will separate the organic and inorganic material that is settled at the bottom, as well as the oil and greases that float on the top layer. The third step will process biological waste, followed by disinfection, nutrient removal, or solid removal, and discharge into nearby water bodies.
Does the sewage treatment plant need electricity?		
All sewage treatment plants require electricity, but there are sewage systems that can function without it. They are tiny filters that include a septic tank and a filter. It distinguishes between solid and liquid waste. Following that, they will collect all liquid waste in a filter. A sewage treatment plant’s pre-treatment operation is a septic tank. In the absence of oxygen, the filter will perform the sedimentation operation. The water will be purified and reused.

Why sewage treatment plant is required?			
Domestic sewage comprises a variety of hazardous and non-hazardous components that must be treated before being released into the environment. There are various sewage treatment advantages. Some of them are:
Because they can handle large amounts of sewage, domestic sewage treatment plants save time.
Sewage treatment plants are benign since they filter all toxic substances that escape a residential area and prepare them for disposal in neighbouring water bodies.
It encouraged people to dwell in underdeveloped areas. We can install this system in residential areas without a big drainage infrastructure.
