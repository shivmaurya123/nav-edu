1.	WOG Technology - Working of Anaerobic digester		
An anaerobic digester is a biological process of breakdown of natural pollutants in wastewater without oxygen. These microorganisms take the oxygen from the oxides present in the effluent. Anaerobic bacteria make biogas by decomposing natural contaminants in wastewater. It is mostly composed of Methane and carbon dioxide. Biogas could be used as a gas alternative. Wastewater is injected into a bioreactor unit containing sludge in anaerobic treatment. It's a thick, semi-solid material that contains microorganisms that break down organic contaminants in wastewater. Food leftovers, animal manures, fats, oils, grease, and industrial organic residuals can all be handled in a digester. Construction and operation differ depending on the type of waste stream to be treated. Anaerobic wastewater treatment is used to treat wastewater from a variety of industries, including the food, paper, and pulp industries, as well as the sewage industry after it has been treated to minimize hydrogen sulphide. Anaerobic digestion has the greatest advantage of reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by extracting methane from wastewater.
•	Importance of recycling industrial wastewater			
•	Recycling industrial wastewater is critical for sustaining freshwater supplies, as long as it is properly processed and cleansed to guarantee that it is fit for human use.
•	Industrial wastewater recycling is recycling or purifying water such that it is free of dangerous substances when dumped into water bodies.
•	One of the most important advantages of recycling water is that it reduces the number of pollutants or chemicals to be drained out into the water bodies.
•	Transportation costs are reduced if firms recycle wastewater near their facilities or use mobile water treatment.
•	As water is a major component of most companies, recycling wastewater from them will aid in ensuring a steady supply of water for the ecosystem.



2.	Main processes of Industrial water treatment			
To treat industrial wastewater, there are four key processes:
•	Floating materials like leaves, papers, and rags, as well as settleable inorganic particles like sand, grid, fats, oils, and greases, will be eliminated in the first step. It removed solids through primary treatment, sedimentation processes, and skimming.
•	In the second step, various biological treatments, such as anaerobic or aerobic treatment, will be performed.
•	It utilized chemical water treatment in the third step to facilitate water recycling, and we know the technique as chemical precipitation or coagulation-aided sedimentation. This method removes over 80% of pollutants from water.
•	In the last step, Sludge wastewater treatment is done, it will dispose of the sewage effluent causing no harm to the environment.


3.	The industrial water treatment system				
Water is purified and made appropriate for reuse after industrial wastewater treatment removes the most dangerous contaminants. It also helps to cut down on industry spending. Depending on the needs of the industries, each industrial wastewater treatment system is unique. Water transports a wide range of waste products and chemical components. Businesses must deal with these contaminants at each level, which may cause oxidation or fine-filtering technologies. It will remove hazardous contaminants and chemical additions from the water at the industrial treatment facility. Industrial wastewater must be treated since it is not properly treated.


4.	Chemical treatment for wastewater recycling management	
Certain types of chemicals are used in chemical wastewater recycling treatment for reducing the pollutants in the wastewater. By using the chemicals various elements will dissolve in wastewater more easily. During precipitation, a previously dissolved ingredient becomes a dissoluble material that can be filtered from the liquid. The chemical treatment process will employ chemicals such as chlorine, hydrogen oxides, sodium chlorite, and sodium hypochlorite.
We use several procedures in the chemical treatment process, including:
•	Neutralization: This process is used to maintain or alter the pH of the wastewater.
•	Chemical precipitation: It is a method of recovering metals present in wastewater, using a variety of chemicals metals get dissolved or precipitate out from the waste.
•	Coagulation and flocculation: This process combines all the finer particles in the water into larger particles that settle out.
•	Ion exchange and disinfection: In this stage, hard water is transformed into soft water by adding sodium ions, and chlorine is added to disinfect the water before it is discharged into bodies of water.


5.	Difference between anaerobic & aerobic water treatment		
The two biological wastewater treatment systems are anaerobic digester water treatment and aerobic digester systems.
•	The fundamental difference between the two is that anaerobic treatment works in the absence of oxygen, whilst aerobic digester treatment works in the presence of oxygen.
•	Aerobic wastewater treatment systems purify water with oxygen-feeding bacteria & protozoa, whereas anaerobic digesters break down and eliminate organic pollutants from wastewater with microorganisms.
•	The demand for circulating wastewater aerobics systems in aerobic treatment makes them less energy efficient while it meant Anaerobic systems to keep biomass sludge from being exposed to air.
•	Aerobic digester systems have greater operational costs than anaerobic digester systems.
•	Methane and carbon dioxide are not produced by aerobic digester treatment, but they are produced by anaerobic digester treatment.

6.	Wide range of industrial water treatment systems		
Most of the hazardous compounds included in wastewater are removed using industrial wastewater treatment systems. There are many different contaminants in wastewater, and it employed different systems to treat them. Some of them are:
•	Raw water treatment systems are used to clean any raw water that is present in the environment, such as rainwater, bodies of water, and underground water. It is a water treatment pre-treatment and optimization approach.
•	Boiler feedwater treatment system: It is used to filter out any dangerous contaminants before they enter the boiler. It will regulate the water’s acidity and conductivity.
•	Wastewater treatment system: In an industrial process, a wastewater treatment system is necessary to treat wastewater. It reduces industrial water use and pollution in the environment.


7.	 Benefits of water recycling plant					(100-150 words)
Water is a plentiful natural resource, yet it is our primary obligation to recycle it for future use. Water recycling is the removal of contaminants from water before it enters a body of water or is reused. Sewage Treatment is the popular name for this wastewater treatment technique for industries. Water recycling has several advantages, including resource conservation and cost savings. We can use recycled water from diverse industries for a variety of purposes, including agriculture, landscape and irrigation, and mining. There are various benefits of recycling plants.
•	Recycling water is also vital for restoring it to its natural state in forests and wetlands, as well as maintaining environmental water sustainability.
•	Recycling industrial wastewater can help ease the demand for freshwater supplies for agricultural uses like irrigating, commercial and residential landscaping, and irrigation.
•	Most industries use water as their coolant and solvent and they also produced it as a by-product, so recycling wastewater will help in reducing the water supply requirement of large industrial plants.
•	Recycling water will also reduce the transportation cost of water. As various mobile recycling treatment plants are also available to recycle the wastewater onsite without its transport from one area to another.
•	Recycling wastewater from industrial areas and residential areas will maintain water sustainability for future generations without reducing the supply for the present generation.


8.	Anaerobic digester role in wastewater management		(100-150 words)
They typically regard anaerobic digestion as a benign wastewater treatment method.
•	The biogas in the anaerobic digester is methane, which can generate electricity from sludge.
•	The sewage produced by anaerobic digesters contains CH4, a valuable energy source for electricity generation.
•	Constructing anaerobic digesters near a residential area creates new local jobs and raises local tax revenue.
•	It enhances the sludge’s quality, lowering its detrimental impact on the neighbouring agricultural area.
•	Alteration of animal waste and compost into a fertilizer that is easier for plants to absorb, with fewer smells and disease-causing chemicals.
•	Sustainable organic waste management has several environmental advantages.
