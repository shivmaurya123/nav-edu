The Effluent Treatment Plant is used for treating wastewater produced from industries. Some of the industries are Textiles, chemicals, beverages and many more. In an Effluent Treatment Plant, a variety of contaminants such as organic and non-organic materials will be corrected during the wastewater treatment process. Effluent Water Treatment is critical in several industries. It eliminates all hazardous substances from the water and uses various processes to repair them.
An industrial effluent treatment plant's (ETP) processes are divided as :
•	Preliminary Treatment: This step will physically separate big pollutants. for example. Fabric, paper, polymers, and wood logs.
•	Primary Treatment: We use both physical and chemical procedures in this treatment. It filters the water from floating elements, suspended particles, and organic matter.
•	Secondary or Biological Treatment: Biological and chemical systems are used in this phase. It eliminates suspended particles and organics elements that will not remove in primary treatment.

a.	Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP)					
ETPs are water treatment plants that recycle wastewater effluent which is produced as a by-product in industries. The purpose of releasing clean water into the environment is to ensure that chemical pollutants do not affect the environment. Various toxic or non-biodegradable effluents are present depending on the industry. We can find organic contaminants in the food and beverage industries. Because industrial wastewater contains a diverse range of contaminants, a treatment method for them is required.


b.	Wastewater Treatment Plants					
Wastewater treatment, often known as sewage treatment, is a procedure that purifies water by eliminating some or all impurities, allowing it to be discharged back into the environment. Untreated wastewater contains significant levels of organic material, pathogenic microbes, nutrients, and toxic substances that can be hazardous to human health, the environment, and waterways. Effective wastewater treatment is therefore critical. The primary goal of wastewater treatment plants is to generate water that we can reuse in a more environmentally friendly and healthy manner. Treatment of wastewater is a critical component in water pollution prevention.

FAQ-
a.	What are the specific types of wastewater treatment?			
Wastewater treatment is a technique that improves water quality by removing all impurities, allowing them to be reused or discharged back into the environment. They roughly categorised wastewater treatment methods into three types, which are:
•	Physical treatment is the process of removing pollutants/contaminants on a physical basis.
•	Chemical treatment is removing impurities or harmful wastes through chemical reactions.
•	Biological treatment is the process of removal of contaminants through biological processes.


b.	What are the main types of water treatment plants?			
A treatment facility is required to treat wastewater in an industrial process. It lowers industrial water consumption and pollution to the environment. If processed in a treatment plant, a significant amount of industrial on-site effluent may be reused. There are several types of treatment plants.
•	Wastewater Treatment Plant- It will treat wastewater generated by industry.
•	Effluent Treatment Plant - This plant will treat industrial effluent.
•	Sewage Treatment Plant - This plant will recycle sewage from residential or commercial areas.
•	Water Treatment Plant - This plant will purify the water and prepare it for reuse.
c.	What is a water treatment plant?					
A water treatment plant is a system that is used to remove polluted elements from water. These materials can be solids, liquids, or semi-solids. Many industries rely on water as their primary source of water. We will dispose of water into adjacent water bodies at the end of the operation, affecting the environment. Wastewater that is treated will allow it to be reused.
d.	What is an effluent treatment plant?					
ETPs are used to remove all harmful toxins from water and include several procedures to do so. We use effluent Treatment Plants for a variety of contaminants, including chemical treatment, biological treatment, chemical and biological treatment combined, and heat treatment. Our experts have the knowledge and experience to provide dependable water purification solutions.
e.	Why effluent treatment plant is necessary?					
Effluent Treatment Plants are important in eliminating all harmful chemicals from the water as this water will be disposed of in the environment. Recycling of wastewater is necessary for every industry as per government rules of disposal of wastewater from the industries. It now becomes mandatory for industries to set up ETPs. After ETPs wastewater become reusable, and can be used for various purposes.
