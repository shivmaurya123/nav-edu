	   1.	Reverse osmosis process for water purification			
The technology of reverse osmosis, sometimes known as RO, is used for water purification. It used a membrane in this technique to break down big molecules since they cannot cross the membrane and remain on the pressured side. The membrane will allow the solvent or clean water to pass through. Molecules of the solute concentrate on one side of the membrane, while the other side of the membrane becomes diluted. The freshwater produced is known as permeate. Wastewater or brine is the concentrated water that remains. Reverse osmosis occurs when the solvent travels across the membrane against the concentration gradient. We know the minimal pressure required to stop solvent flow through a membrane as the osmotic pressure. When higher pressure is supplied to the solvent particles than the osmotic pressure, it moves the solvents from a high concentration zone to a low concentration region, resulting in reverse osmosis.
2.	Requirements of mobile water treatment plants for industries		
Every enterprise that produces water as a by-product or as an effluent needs to treat it. Every human being has a responsibility to conserve our available natural resources, and one of them is water. Several businesses demand mobile water treatment because,
•	It decreases transportation costs and it can be installed near a wastewater treatment plant.
•	It is beneficial to enterprises if the original water treatment facility fails.
•	Purifying the water takes less time because there is no significant apparatus involved.
•	It is a transportable water treatment system that can be transported to any location inside a container, lowering the cost of purification plant setup and installation.


3.	Process of Mobile Water Treatment					

The mobile water treatment plant works in the same manner as another water treatment plant operates. The main purpose of the mobile water treatment plant is to recycle water for various other purposes. Mobile wastewater treatment has a wide range of applications in a wide range of sectors. They can be utilized in industries for short-term, long-term, and emergency services. Treated water cannot be used for drinking purposes. There are various steps to recycle water. 
•	The preliminary treatment includes the removal of floating items such as leaves, papers, and rags, as well as settleable inorganic particles including sand, grid, fats, oils, and greases.
•	A sedimentation or settling procedure is used in primary treatment. In the regular sewage treatment procedure, sedimentation occurs twice: once before secondary treatment and again after secondary treatment. We call the process chemical precipitation or coagulation-aided sedimentation when chemical coagulants are used to promote or help sedimentation.
•	Secondary- Before releasing wastewater into the environment, this phase eliminates germs. Secondary water treatment removes more than 80% of impurities from water, making it soluble and ready to be disposed of away.
•	Chemicals are used to disinfect the water during tertiary treatment. It is a very expensive method that is only utilized in exceptional circumstances.


4.	Mobile Drinking Water Treatment System				
Mobile water treatment plants can be set up anywhere to ensure clean water for industries. It ideally suited mobile water purification units for the population if an established water purification plant fails. Each purification procedure, will treat the complete unit and transport it within a container. It filters out any dangerous substances from the water and fixes them using several methods. Mobile treatment plants are available in a range of sizes and styles. Depending on the type of water we’re working with and the treatment process we’re employing. Mobile treatment plants will come in a range of designs and sizes in the future.


5.	Steps to be followed in the mobile water treatment system		  

A wide range of businesses requires industrial water filtration. It filters out any potentially dangerous substances from the water and fixes them using several methods. Businesses must deal with these pollutants at every stage, whether through oxidation or fine filtering. In each of these operations, different pollutants were defeated. The water became cleaner as the stages went on. Existing mobile water treatment facilities use some of these processes. In wastewater treatment, both chemical and membrane separation procedures are useful.
These plants, for example, use the following techniques:
•	Getting & filtering large particles
•	Chemical transformations
•	Coagulation and flocculation
•	Clarification and Sedimentation
•	Disinfection and filtration
•	Distribution and storage


6.	Mobile water filtration system						
One of the most effective ways to filter surface water is to use mobile water filtration equipment. They can be moved as needed for a short length of time, a longer time, or an instant demand. After filtration, mobile water treatment devices generate high-quality water for a one-time expenditure. We use them in a variety of operations; filtering entails performing certain processes on wastewater, such as reverse osmosis, filtration, and dechlorinating water, among others, so that we can reuse it for agricultural or washing purposes. It can be used for irrigation if it is properly treated. Water filtered through a system can be utilized for a variety of purposes other than drinking.
7.	Water Treatment is essential in which industries				
Water is used as a primary production component in several industries. For water sustainability, a constant supply of freshwater is required. Water treatment is an important stage because it will discharge the treated water into surrounding water bodies, causing environmental damage. Food processing, power generation, manufacturing, textiles, the health industry, and agriculture are some businesses that require water treatment.
•	Food processing - Different procedures in this business cause a considerable volume of water. Following this, the wastewater generated is acidic, making it unfit for reuse.
•	Power generation is the industry that generates the greatest volume of wastewater. It contains heavy metals and insoluble materials that must be treated correctly.
•	Textile industry—water is a key component, and many colors and chemicals are employed and need the proper water treatment plant.


8.	Different applications of mobile water treatment systems			
We can use mobile water filtration systems at construction sites, refugee camps, military camps, and oil and mining camps, among other places. We can utilize it in any setting that requires sanitary equipment. Because these systems are mobile, they can use anywhere and do not require installation. They’ve already been installed in a shipping container.
•	Refugee camps and military camps are underdeveloped locations with no suitable sewage treatment facilities. In these areas, mobile treatment works wonders in reducing the environmental impact of untreated water.
•	Huge construction site or labor site - If a large manufacturing or building site is present, labor is housed in a nearby region with no sewage or drainage system. This technique is useful in those locations where untreated water or human waste can generate major disease-causing microorganisms and cause severe environmental impact.


9.	  Types of the various mobile treatment plant				
We utilize mobile water treatment facilities in a variety of industries and applications. They are dependable, swift, and adaptable to any situation. It does not cause any installation. One of the most essential advantages of a mobile water system is that it can arrive on-site quickly and readily deliver drinking water to a large group of people. It is extremely beneficial for wastewater recycling in many regions where there is no suitable sewage treatment plant. They come in a variety of sizes and shapes to meet the needs of diverse sectors.
